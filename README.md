ToDoList Web Application

Project Description:
I developed a ToDoList web application where users can register, log in, and manage their personal notes. Each user has a private space to create, edit, delete, and mark their notes as completed, with completed notes being visually crossed out.

Project Features:
	•	User registration and login system
	•	Personalized data management (notes are user-specific and private)
	•	CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for notes
	•	“Mark as Completed” feature with a visual indication

Technologies Used:
	•	Backend: PHP and MySQL
	•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	•	Database Management: phpMyAdmin
	•	Security: User authentication and session management
